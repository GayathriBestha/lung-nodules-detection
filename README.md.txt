Example:  
- **Left:** Original CT Image  
- **Right:** Detected Lung Nodules with bounding box and pixel value

![Detected Lung Nodules](images/output image.png)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `lung_nodule_detection.m` in MATLAB.
2. Make sure the image file is in the working directory.
3. Make sure the input image is in the current folder.
4. Run the script to view original and processed images.
5. Detected regions will be highlighted on the image.

## 📌 Notes
- The image must be a grayscale or CT scan format.
- This is a prototype for academic purposes and not for medical diagnosis.
